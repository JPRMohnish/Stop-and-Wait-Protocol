# Stop-and-Wait-Protocol

This project implements the stop-and-wait protocol using sockets and threading. The stop and wait protocol is a special case of the Go-back-N protocol , with window size = 1. Through this project we have illustrated and then tackled the possible errors that can happen through erroneous channels during stop-and-wait protocol communication.
